Grand Format
============

Grand Format is a tiny CSS library to facilitate the creation of storytelling article that uses big size pictures. This library defines some useful rules to create articles similar to the New York Times storytelling format (e.g. [Climate Change Is Killing the Cedars of Lebanon](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/18/climate/lebanon-climate-change-environment-cedars.html)).

A demo of the library is available at the following link: â€¦
